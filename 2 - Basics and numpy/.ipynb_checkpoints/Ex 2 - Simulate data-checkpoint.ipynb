    "You want to test some new modeling strategy, but you didn't collect enough data yet. A good approach is then to try generate an artificial dataset with more or less the same characteristics. Here we are going to try generate a dataset of noisy oscillations, practicing numpy arrays and numpy functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data we want to simulate consist of $N_c$ channels. Each channels it's a timecourse consisting of $N_t$ timepoints. The signal in each channel should be a sinusoidal signal with given frequency $\\omega$ and random phase $\\phi_c$ (uniformly distributed in [$0,2\\pi$]. Then, each channel will have some gaussian noise (normally distributed random numbers) $n_c(t)$. The overall signal should then be\n",

    "<b>Tips:</b>\n",
    "- Start simple. Start with one channel and few timepoints, so that you can visualize your arrays. Keep the $N_c$ and $N_t$ parameters as variables, so that you can just change their value to increase the size of your dataset.\n",

    "- Fit the points and retrieve the phases of each sinusoidal signal. You can do this with a function from scipy called curve fit. To import it write ```from scipy.optimize import curve_fit```? in your code. You can then check the documentation (with the ?, or online) to see how to use it. You will need to define a fit function, this would be a normal python function that describes the data, e.g.,\n",
