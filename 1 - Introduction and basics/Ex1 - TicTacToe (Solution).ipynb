    "The goal of this excercie is to build a rudimentary version of tictactoe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game will alternate two players (1 and 2) who are asked for coordinates of the location where they want to put their symbol ('X' or 'O'). The goals are:\n",
    "- To write a code that asks each player alternatively to insert a pair of coordinate x,y where x and y can be 1,2 or 3.\n",
    "- Each entry should update a \"board\" by writing the symbol corresponding to each player in the coordinates specified by the player.\n",
    "- The board is a list of lists (2D list) consisting of 3 rows and 3 columns.\n",
    "- There should be an option to reset the game or to exit\n",
    "- Instructions on how to insert coordinates, how to exit or reset the game should be given to the players at the beginning of each game.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Tips</b>:\n",
    "- To make things more intuitive at the beginning you could think of rounds and players independently. This means that you can have a loop to go through each round and then a second (inner) loop to go trough players.\n",
    "- Keep in mind that python starts counting from 0. If you want coordinates to be 1,2,3 you have to account for that.\n",
    "- You can use dictionaries to convert player number to player symbol;\n",
    "- You might want to print the board after every new entry in the game. To make it look like a proper (2D) board you should consider printing it row by row.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bonus:\n",
    "As a bonus you could have a function that checks whether someone has won the game and end it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Tip</b>:\n",
    "- You can use dictionaries to convert the symbols ('X' and 'O') into numbers (e.g., 1 and -1). Then it might be easier to check if in a row (or column, or diagonal) there are 3 ones or 3 minus ones."
