    "In this exercise you are given a dataset consisting of several columns: the first column represents time, the other columns are (fake) data from an experiment in which we measure the activity of a neuron/signal of an eeg electrode/voxel in an fmri experiment. This activation can be modeled as a gaussian peak with an unknown amplitude and width. The goals of this exercise are\n",

    "1. Fit and plot the results for one of the experimental data columns with a custom made gaussian function:\n",
    "    - import the data with numpy\n",
    "    - define a gaussian function for the fit, this will be a python function that will need as input parameters the x variable and the parameters of the gaussian, and will return the values of the corresponding gaussian function.\n",
    "    - import and use curve_fit from scipy.optimize for fitting your previously defined function to the data\n",
    "    - plot the data and the corresponding fit, with the data represented as points and the fit as a line, and include a legend.\n",
    "    - store the output parameters in a list or numpy array and save them in a file parameters.txt\n",
    "    - save the figure in a file called fit_{column_number}.png.\n",

    "2. Fit and plot the results for all the experimental data columns:\n",
    "    - This will be exactly the same as the earlier part, but in this case you will iterate the procedure (no copy paste) for all the columns in the input file.\n",
    "    - store all the output parameters in a list or numpy array and save them in a file parameters.txt\n",
    "    - save the figures in a file called fit_{column_number}.png.\n",
    "    - make a scatterplot of the amplitude and standard deviations obtained from the fits and save it as a figure.\n",

    "- A generic gaussian function is defined as;\n",
    "$$G(x) = A\\exp{-\\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}},$$\n",
    "where $A$ is the amplitude, $x_0$ the center and $\\sigma$ the standard deviation.\n",
    "- Read the documentation of curve_fit to understand how to use it\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Some fits are not looking good, are they?</b>\n",
    "When fitting a gaussian it might be important to give to the fitting function some starting parameters that you think are close to the actual result. A good ide could be to assume the peak is in the middle and to have a rough estimate of its width and amplitude before launching the fit. You can input these parameters in curve_fit as an optional argument, e.g., curve_fit(......., p0 = [4,50,3])."
